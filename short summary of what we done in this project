In this project, we focused on cleaning and preprocessing a marketing campaign dataset to make it ready for analysis. The main steps included:

Loading the dataset and handling missing values by filling them with the median of the respective columns.

Removing duplicate rows to ensure data consistency.

Standardizing text data in columns like 'Education' and 'Marital_Status' by cleaning up spaces and converting to lowercase.

Converting date formats for easier analysis.

Renaming columns for consistency and clarity.

Correcting data types for various columns, such as converting income to a float and family-related columns to integers.

Saving the cleaned dataset for future use.
